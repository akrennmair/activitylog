an unordered TODO list
======================

- provide feeds of the most recent activities by user. only show public activities.
- make type of activity configurable. configurable aspects are:
	- activity is a point in time vs. activity has a start and end timestamp.
	- activity can be rated
	- activity contains a numeric value (e.g. number of calories, weight of poo, current heart rate, etc.)
- the mobile user interface shall detect when it's offline, and store its data in localstorage until it is online again. when online, sync with server.
- provide a mobile UI and a web UI. 
	- the mobile UI shall only allow a bare minimum, such as adding activities, adding activity types and viewing recent activities.
	- the web UI shall provide the whole experience: full configuration, adding activities, and detailed views of activities including stats, graphs, etc.
- implement CSRF protection

- social interface: users can follow each other and see their public activities

- provide an API for external applications to post events. This is useful for integrating external services and devices.
